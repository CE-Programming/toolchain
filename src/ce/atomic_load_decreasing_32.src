; Compare and return the greater of the two values read.

; If the values differ, then the underlying value changed between reading the
; first byte of the first 32-bit read and the last byte of the second 32-bit
; read:
;  * If a change occurs between the two 32-bit reads, then both values read
;	remain valid.
;  * If a change occurs in the middle of one of the 32-bit reads:
;	 * If the bytes already read change but the bytes yet to read do not
;	   change, then the value read is the valid value before the change.
;	 * If the bytes already read do not change but the yet still to read
;	   change, then the value read is the valid value after the change.
;	 * If the bytes already read and the bytes yet to read change, then the
;	   value read is an invalid mix of the values before and after the change.
;
; If the final case did not occur, then both values read are valid.
;
; If the final case occurred for only the second value read, then due to reading
; bytes in little-endian order, one to three upper bytes will reflect the
; decreased value after the change. Regardless of the lower bytes, the valid,
; first value read will be greater than the invalid, second value read.
;
; If the final case occurred for only the first value read, then due to reading
; bytes in little-endian order, one to three upper bytes will reflect the
; decreased value after the change, while the remaining one to three lower bytes
; will reflect the value before the change. If it is assumed that the value
; decreased by less than 256, then the upper bytes must have decreased through
; borrow and the lower bytes of the valid, second value read will be greater
; than the lower bytes of the invalid, first value read. And because the full
; second value read will reflect the the decreased value after the change, and
; therefore the two values read will only differ in the lower bytes, it follows
; that the full, valid, second valid read will be greater than the full,
; invalid, first value read. (Note that this assertion can be extended to
; include 256 because only one byte would change, making this whole case
; unreachable.)
;
; If the final case occurred for both values read, then both are invalid. There
; is no reasonable way to detect this, so it is assumed that this did not occur.
;
; Combining all of these cases and assumptions, the greater of the two values
; read will always be valid.
