/**
 * @file
 * @brief USB FAT Filesystem Driver
 *
 * This library can be used to communicate with Mass Storage Devices (MSD) which
 * have partitions formated as FAT32. (FAT16 support is implemented yet untested).
 * It currently only supports drives that have a sector size of 512, which is pretty
 * much every flash drive on the market, except for huge ones.
 * The drive must use MBR partitioning, GUID is not supported yet.
 *
 * WARNING: Currently fatdrvce cannot operate in programs that use os_GetCSC().
 * Please use an alternative such as kb_Scan(), avaiable in the keypadc library.
 *
 * Example program showing initialization and teardown of FAT devices:
 * @code
 *
 * #define MAX_PARTITIONS 10
 *
 * void main(void) {
 *     static fat_partition_t fat_partitions[MAX_PARTITIONS];
 *     static uint8_t sector[512];
 *     static jmp_buf msdenv;
 *     msd_event_t evnt;
 *     uint8_t num;
 *
 *     // Configure USB error handling, e.g. removal before write is finished
 *     if ((evnt = setjmp(msdenv))) {
 *         // Tell the user there was an error with USB here
 *     }
 *     msd_SetJmpBuf(msdenv);
 *
 *     // Initialize the first attached MSD device
 *     if (msd_Init(10000) != 0) {
 *         // No MSD devices found
 *     }
 *
 *     // Set the buffer used by the FAT library
 *     fat_SetBuffer(sector);
 *
 *     // Locate available FAT partitions on the MSD device
 *     if ((num = fat_Find(fat_partitions, MAX_PARTITIONS) == 0) {
 *         // No FAT partitions found
 *     }
 *
 *     // Select the first (or other) FAT partition on the MSD
 *     fat_Select(fat_partitions, 0);
 *
 *     // Initialize the selected FAT partition
 *     if (fat_Init() != 0) {
 *         // Failed to initialize FAT partition
 *     }
 *
 *     // Here is where you can perform any other open/read/write operations
 *
 *     // Deinitialize FAT and MSD subsystems
 *     fat_Deinit();
 *     msd_Deinit();
 * }
 * @endcode
