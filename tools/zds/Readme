A. CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS RELEASE
==============================================================================
    Refer  to  the 'Migrating from a Previous Release' section  of the FAQ for
    information  and  pointers related  to  migrating/converting  existing ZDS
    projects and targets.

    (to 5.3.0)
    - Support has been added for Structured Assembly code.  This feature is 
      described fully in the section Using the Macro Assembler > Structured
      Assembly in the ZDS II Online Help.  Previously this feature was
      undocumented and had numerous bugs, but now it has been tested and is
      ready for use.
    - An extended form of the #pragma asm directive has been added to more
      easily support extended sections of embedded assembly code in C
      programs.

    - Updated RZK/ZTP to 2.5.0.
      Please read RZK_ZTP_ReleaseNotes.txt for details
    - Added a right-mouse click editor feature to block/unblock C comments.
    - Added long filename support in generated makefile, linker command and 
      library command files.
    - Added hierarchical display of dependency include files below the source
      file in the workspace window.
    - Added register address display in the SFR window when a register is 
      hovered.
     -Added column sorting for symbol window.
    
    (to 5.2.1)

    - Updated documentation
    - Updated RZK/ZTP to 2.4.1.
      Please read RZK_ZTP_ReleaseNotes.txt for details

    (to 5.2.0)
    - A new option, "Pad Branch",  has been added  for  C code projects, which
      greatly improves the ease of debugging.  When this option is selected in
      a debug build,  breakpoint  operation  is  much  enhanced  over  earlier 
      releases of ZDS II for Acclaim.

      Processor pipeline  issues  that  formerly  caused unexpected failure to
      break, or extremely slow performance when breakpoints were placed inside
      loops, can  now  easily be avoided.  See  items  19  and  20 below under
      Precautions and Limitations: Debugger and Programmer,and the ZDS II User
      Manual, for more details.
    - Added  external flash support  for Spansion Flash S29GL064N and ST Flash
      M29W640FB70N6E
    - Changed edit box display to list box  in the project->settings->linker->
      additional objects and library page
    - Numerous  Change  Requests  have  been  addressed.  Refer  to the Closed 
      Change Requests section.

    (to 5.1.1)
    - Change Request 13067, a crucial defect  affecting  the implementation of
      some  switch-case statements in C code,  has been fixed.  This issue may
      manifest itself in incorrect prompt behavior in some applications.

D. APPLICATION AND OTHER OS ISSUES
==============================================================================
   1.  Apply  the  latest  Windows updates to the host system when appropriate.

   2.  ZDS II  will  terminate  an active target connection when the host goes
       into Stand by or Hibernate.  If  a wireless Ethernet connection is used
       with the ZPAK, ZDS may not be able to reconnect to the ZPAK.  Reset the
       ZPAK if this is encountered.

   3.  Some systems with  one or more other USB devices connected may not boot
       properly after connecting the USB Smart Cable.
       Workaround:  Connect the USB Smart Cable  after  the system has started.


E. PRECAUTIONS AND LIMITATIONS
==============================================================================
    Debugger & Programmer
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. If  Flash memory  is programmed to use the Watch-Dog Timer, or HALT/SLP
       instructions within the first few instructions after reset,the debugger
       may not be able to gain control of the target.
       Refer to FAQ 'How is the new Hardware Reset Implemented?'  for  informa-
       tion on how to apply a fix for this problem.

    2. The  ZDS debugger  may  not  be  able to maintain a reliable connection
       with a target that uses the Watch-Dog Timer (WDT)  to  generate a reset
       so disabling the WDT during a debug session is recommended.  If the WDT
       generates an NMI, the debugger  will not lose the target connection and
       the default boot module's NMI handler may be replaced by an application
       specific NMI handler.

    3. The  eZ80  and eZ80Acclaim! working registers may become corrupt during
       a debug session if code  is  executed from zero wait state memory. This
       applies to internal and external memory.

       Workaround:  Debug the code in one or more  wait state memory.  You may
                    do  this  by  adding wait  states to the internal Flash or
                    the external Chip Select control register.

    4. Program  execution  may  not break or will break after breakpoints that
       are set inside internal SRAM.

    5. The  maximum amount  of  breakpoints supported by the hardware is three 
       while the simulator has no limit..
 
    6. The  Zilog  development  tools  may not reset all internal registers to
       their hardware reset state  after a  connection is established and/or a
       debug reset is performed.  This  may  allow a previously loaded program
       to interact with the operation  of the  current program's debug session.
       For example, if Flash  was  previously  loaded with a program that uses
       timer 3 interrupts, a program that  is  running  in debug mode and does
       NOT reset the timer 3 registers to disable its  interrupts  will  still
       encounter a timer 3 interrupt request.

       Workaround:  Erase the internal flash with the integrated  Flash Loader
                    to prevent any unused registers  from  being  changed from
                    its hardware reset state.

    7. Some Port Authority USB to Serial DB9 adapters provided by Cables to Go
       are not compatible with the Serial Smart Cable for eZ80Acclaim!.

    8. ZDS  may  have difficulty establishing a connection if a Flash resident
       program  has enabled and selected the PLL as the system clock.  In this
       event, select the  Oscillator Clock option  and  set  the  System Clock
       Frequency equal to the frequency of the system clock that was used with
       the  PLL  enabled  and selected.  Then  erase  the  program, disconnect,
       restore the Clock settings to  their appropriate values, and  reconnect.
       Refer to the Debugging section of the FAQ for more information.

    9. The  Flash programmer  may  identify  blocks  of  Flash  that  are  not
       physically  present  on  the  application board if the chip select that
       enables the Flash device is  programmed  with  a  higher  boundary then
       what is physically available.

   10. The USB  and  Ethernet Smart Cable  will hold the  reset line low if it
       detects a target power loss.

   11. The  ZDS flash  programmer  requires  the  external flash device memory
       locations  to  be  aligned  with  the  flash  device's  specified block
       arrangement, otherwise  the  entire  flash device will not be erased or
       programmed correctly.
       For example, the  Micron flash  on  the  eZ80Acclaim! modules should be
       placed on a  1MB boundary because  the  upper  four  address lines  are
       ignored when  it  is  enabled.  If  the  chip select  lower boundary is
       040000h,  an access  at  the  same  location  would result in an access
       of block 6 instead of block 0.

   12. Connecting  the ZPAK's TIM directly to the target board's ZDI connector
       is recommended.  If an adaptor  is  required  avoid  using wire wrap or
       any other prototype material otherwise download,  program  and/or debug
       operations may not be reliable.  When  using an adaptor,  the following
       changes  to  the  ZPAK TIM  (Zilog PC: 99C0853-001) may  help  increase
       communication reliability:

       a) Change R10 to 10-22 Ohm.
       b) Change R6 to 2.2K if changing R10 does not help.

   13. Debug  and  Flash program  operations  may  not  be reliable on targets
       with system clock frequencies less than 5MHz.

   14. The simulator does not support UART input.

   15. The simulator treats halt/sleep instruction as a NOP.

   16. ZDS opens a UDP port to search  for Ethernet Smart Cables and should be
       allowed  to  do so  through  an active firewall that stands between ZDS
       and  the  Ethernet  Smart  Cable.  The  firewall  may  be  disabled  or
       configured to grant ZDS the right  to open a local UDP port.  The local
       port number is assigned by the host and the foreign port number is 3000.

   17. Working  with  large   projects  across  a  network  may  saturate  the 
       communication  interface  of  the  host computer.  ZDS  may report "Not 
       Responding" messages while it is waiting for all the files to be opened.  
       ZDS is actually still loading information  and  will  begin 'responding' 
       as soon as the transfer is complete.  It is recommended that the source 
       files be copied and installed on the ZDS host computer.

   18. Page Erase  of  internal Flash memory is used as the default to protect
       user  data  or  programs (i.e. Boot Loaders ) in  Flash.  The  user can 
       select  mass  erase  by  removing  the  check  mark from the Project ->    
       Settings ->  Debugger tab  "Use Page Erase Before Flashing".  When Page 
       Erase is selected, note that the debugger will erase  all pages  within 
       the program's address range prior  to  programming Flash.   The address 
       range is determined by the lowest  and  highest  addresses contained in 
       the .LOD file and those pages and all the pages in  between  are erased 
       in one step to speed the download process.  If  the  program overlaps a 
       page by a single byte  the  entire  page  will be erased. (i.e. For ROM 
       Address Range: 0-38, 8000-FF00, the .LOD download will  erase the Flash 
       from 0-FFFF).  The Flash Loader can be used  if  you  need  to download
       non-overlapping .HEX files  in  non-sequential  order  because  the ZDS 
       linker will sort the addresses when the file is created  and  the Flash 
       Loader  can  then  determine  the  exact pages to erase.  (i.e. For ROM 
       address Range:  0-38,  8000-FF00  the  .HEX  download  will erase 0-1FF 
       (entire page) and 8000-FFFF).

   19. Due  to  the  instruction  pipeline,  it  is  not  recommended to set a
       breakpoint on the 1st instruction of an ISR.
	   
       In version 5.2.0, a  new option is provided that will take care of this
       issue for you automatically in your C code.  If you select "Insert NOPs
       to  improve  Debugger breakpoints” in the C > Advanced page  of project
       settings, the compiler will insert a few NOPs at the beginning  of your
       ISR, eliminating this problem.  You can then simply set the  breakpoint
       in your C code on the opening  curly  brace  of  your ISR.  This option
       comes at the cost of a modest increase in code size from the added NOPs;
       when you’re finished debugging, turning the  feature  off again removes
       the NOPs and gets rid of the added code size.
	   
       If  you  choose  not to use this new feature, you will need to manually
       ensure  that  you  set  breakpoints  at  least 3 bytes beyond the first 
       instruction of all ISRs.

   20. Why  does  it  take a long time to hit a breakpoint in a loop or branch
       statement?

       Due to the instruction pipeline  in eZ80, eZ80Acclaim! and  eZ80Acclaim
       Plus! processors,it is impossible to break execution on the instruction
       following a branch instruction such as JR, JP, LDIR, etc. This can lead
       to false breaks  or extremely slow execution as the debugger repeatedly
       stops and resumes execution.
	   
       In version 5.2.0, a new option is provided  that will take care of this 
       issue for you automatically in your C code.  If you select "Insert NOPs
       to improve Debugger breakpoints"  in the C > Advanced page  of  project 
       settings,  the  compiler  will  insert  a  few  NOPs  following  branch 
       instructions, eliminating this problem.  You  can  then  simply set the
       breakpoint wherever you wish  in your C code,  and  the  debugger  will 
       execute at its proper speed and break only when it should.  This option
       comes at the cost of a modest increase in code size from the added NOPs;
       when you’re finished debugging, turning the feature off again removes
       the NOPs and gets rid of the added code size.
	   
       If you choose not  to use  this  new feature, you will need to manually
       ensure  that  you always set breakpoints 3 or 4 instructions beyond all
       branches for best execution speed and debugging results.

       Example ( when "Insert NOPS to  improve  Debugger  breakpoints  is  NOT
                 selected):

       C- Code:
    
       static void breakpointDelayTest(void *addr_ptr,INT16 size) 
       {
         char *test_ptr;
         INT16 ctr = 0; 
         test_ptr = (char *)addr_ptr;
         while(ctr < size) 
         {
           *test_ptr = 0;
           test_ptr++;
           ctr++;
         }
       } ; setting a breakpoint here will set the breakpoint  at line 0003C1 below.

       Assembly Instructions:
       }
         0003BF 18D0 JR %391
       }
         0003C1 DDF9 LD SP,IX        ; instead of setting the BP on this line
         0003C3 DDE1 POP IX          ;
         0003C5 C9 RET               ; <<< it's recommended to insert breakpoint here
    
   21. Flashloader fails programming Spansion flash with USB firmware 1.8 at 5MHZ.
	    
       This is an issue related with the waitstate configured in the CSx_CTL rather than
       the firmware. At low frequency, on-chip debugger interface (ZDI) frequency sometimes
       does not in sync with the target frequency, resulting in a frequency mismatch. The 
       workaround in this case is to reduce the waitstates 4 or less.
		
    Compiler, Assembler, Linker/Locator, & Librarian
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. The ZDS II Assembler processes macros in a way that is more consistent 
       with the C preprocessor than was the case in ZDS I. Users converting 
       ZDS I projects to ZDS II projects and encountering problems with their 
       macros should contact Technical Support for help.

    2. Due to some efficiency improvements made in support routines for the 
       eZ80Acclaim! compiler in the 4.9.0 release of ZDS II, libraries and 
       objects built with the 4.9.0 or later compiler are not compatible with 
       libraries or objects built with earlier versions of the compiler.  If 
       your application includes pre-built libraries or object files, you will 
       need to rebuild them using the new compiler in order to use them with 
       newly built code.  Failure to do so may have several manifestations; 
       one that has been observed in several instances is that a breakpoint 
       set at the beginning of main() will never be reached.

    IDE
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Options available via Project > Settings... have been reworked for 
       more efficient and correct use.  Note that some options that existed
       in the multiple settings tabs have been moved to the General tab, most 
       notably Generate Debug Information.  Refer to the ZDS User Manual, 
       Online Help and FAQ for assistance.

    2. The Simulator is now a Debug Tool option, where previously it was a 
       target. This allows the Simulator to better operate more correctly 
       by using target configuration settings.

    3. The Motorola S-Record format is not supported.  Utilities exist to 
       convert files to the S-Record format from one or more of the formats 
       supported by ZDS II.  These may be acquired via the Internet using 
       an Internet search site such as Yahoo or Google.

    4. The project conversion utility can not be cancelled and will modify
       the original project (.zdsproj) file.  The backup (.zdsbak) file
       created by the conversion utility may be renamed and used with the
       original version of ZDS.  See the FAQ for more information.
	   
	5. During  the  loading  of  large  projects  (those with a large 
       number of files and/or file dependencies), the ZDS user 
       interface may become non-responsive (CR  7918)

    Sample Projects
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. When using the Serial Smart Cable and starter.zdsproj with eZ80F910x00KIT,
       selecting "[x] Use Alternate ZDI Frequency" option is recommended.
       Deselecting may result in unreliable download, program and debug
       operations.  This is generally observed as inconsistent memory reads.

    2. When using the USB Smart Cable and starter.zdsproj with eZ80F910x00KIT,
       deselecting "[ ] Use Alternate ZDI Frequency" option is recommended.
       Selecting this may result in unreliable download, program and debug
       operations.  This is generally observed as inconsistent memory reads.
       See the FAQ for more information.

    Zilog Standard Library (ZSL)
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Neither hardware nor software flow control is supported.

    Target Hardware
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. The IDE will issue a Hard Reset When connecting to the Target.  A Hard 
       Reset, as described in FAQ 'How is the new Hardware Reset 
       Implemented?', utilizes the target's reset line to reset the processor.  
       This allows the IDE to gain control of the processor in 4 clock cycles.  
       A reset issued while debugging is Soft Reset. A Soft Reset does not 
       gain control of the processor immediately and inserting sleep or halt 
       statements in  the beginning of the code should be avoided.

    2. The Ethernet circuit on F91 Mini Module board number is 99C0942-001
       Rev A and B only:  There is an error on the schematic for the F91 Mini
       Module, and as a result wrong value resistor is mounted on board.
       The R13 should be 6.49K ohm 1% (not 6.81K ohm 1% as shown).

    3. The PRSTn signal from JTAG connector on the eZ80 Development Platform
       (99C0858-001 rev B only) is not connected properly. This was fixed in 
       rev C of the board. For details, see the board schematics in the 
       eZ80 Development Kit User Manuals which can be found at 
       <documentation install>\Documentation\Tools_Documentation.

    4. The J11 silkscreen on the eZ80 Development Platform (99C0858-001) is 
       incorrect. It should be EN_FLASH.

    5. The -DIS_ETH pin on the eZ80190 Module (99C0877-001) is not functional.

    6. The RS-232 DB9 connector ground is not connected on eZ80F91 Modular
       Development Kit Platform (99C0945-001).  It will work if the host 
       system connector is grounded and a shielded ground cable is used.  
       Otherwise connect a wire between P2 pin 5 and P2's mounting holes 
       (shield).

    7. Correction to the eZ80F91 Module schematic in UM0142: The 4.7K 
       pull-down resistor R9 is not required nor recommended.  Remove the 
       resistor to correct; otherwise, JTAG may not function properly.

    8. The eZ80F91 Module 50MHz crystal oscillator circuit is different than
       the recommended circuit in the eZ80F91 product specification PS0192.
       The inductor side of the circuit, on the module, is connected to Xin
       (pin#86) instead of Xout (pin#85).  We recommend the oscillator
       circuit found in the eZ80Acclaim! product specification PS0192.

    9. The eZ80190 module distributed with the eZ801900200ZCO development kit
       uses a 50MHz system oscillator.  If the eZ80190 module is used with
       ZTP projects that use the CS8900 Ethernet controller, the 50MHz
       oscillator must be replaced with a 48MHz oscillator.  Otherwise the
       ZTP projects will not be able to exchange Ethernet data reliably and
       the system may fail to function.

       After replacing the oscillator, it will also be necessary to modify the
       "System Clock Frequency" in the "Configure Target" window from 50000000
       to 48000000.  The "Configure Target" window is accessed from the 
       "Setup" button on the Debugger tab of the Project Settings.  Be sure 
       the appropriate eZ80190 development platform is highlighted.  For 
       example, if you are using the eZ80190 module and the ZPAK II emulator, 
       select the "eZ80DevPlatform_190_Flash - Ethernet" or 
       "eZ80DevPlatform_190_RAM - Ethernet" target configuration depending on 
       your project configuration.

       If you would prefer Zilog to replace the 50MHz oscillator, please 
       contact Zilog customer support for a Return Merchandise Authorization 
       (RMA).

    10. For eZ80 Development Platforms that contain 74LVC244A (U1, U3 and U5):

        Factory rework: Replace 74LVC244A with 74LV244A  The F91 has a very tight 
        timing for read and write operation. Because of the differences of the
        speed of the address  and read/write  drivers  on  the main board, the 
        data in the SRAM  on  the  main board is being corrupted.  To fix  the 
        above mentioned problem we recommend to put a slower drivers (74LV244A)
        on the address bus, which fixes the problem with SRAM corruption.

    Un-installation
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. The Un-installation may not work if WScript.exe in Windows System directory is
       corrupt or missing. In this case, user needs to manually execute the uninstallztp.bat
       first and then uninstall.bat from the ZDSII installation directory.
