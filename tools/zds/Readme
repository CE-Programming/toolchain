A. CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS RELEASE
==============================================================================
    Refer to the 'Migrating from a Previous Release' section of the FAQ for
    information and pointers related to migrating/converting existing ZDS
    projects and targets.

    (to 5.2.0)
    - A new option, "Pad Branch", has been added for C code projects, which greatly
      improves the ease of debugging.  When this option is selected in a debug build,
      breakpoint operation is much enhanced over earlier releases of ZDS II for Acclaim.
      Processor pipeline issues that formerly caused unexpected failure to break, or
      extremely slow performance when breakpoints were placed inside loops, can now
      easily be avoided.  See items 19 and 20 below under Precautions and Limitations:
      Debugger and Programmer, and the ZDS II User Manual, for more details.
    - Added external flash support for Spansion Flash S29GL064N and ST Flash M29W640FB70N6E
    - Changed edit box display to list box in the project->settings->linker->additional objects 
      and library page
    - Numerous Change Requests have been addressed.  Refer to the Closed 
      Change Requests section.

    (to 5.1.1)
    - Change Request 13067, a crucial defect affecting the implementation of some
      switch-case statements in C code, has been fixed.  This issue may manifest
      itself in incorrect prompt behavior in some applications.

    (to 5.1.0)
    - Numerous Change Requests have been addressed.  Refer to the Closed 
      Change Requests section.
    - New linker warnings may be seen, compared to pre-5.0.0 builds.  These warnings alert the
      user to a potentially troublesome linker situation which the user should investigate.  
      A new FAQ has been added describing this issue in full.

D. APPLICATION AND OTHER OS ISSUES
==============================================================================
   1.  Apply the latest Windows updates to the host system when appropriate.

   2.  ZDS II will terminate an active target connection when the host goes
       into Stand by or Hibernate.  If a wireless Ethernet connection is used
       with the ZPAK, ZDS may not be able to reconnect to the ZPAK.  Reset the
       ZPAK if this is encountered.

   3.  Some systems with one or more other USB devices connected may not boot
       properly after connecting the USB Smart Cable.
       Workaround:  Connect the USB Smart Cable after the system has started.


E. PRECAUTIONS AND LIMITATIONS
==============================================================================
    Debugger & Programmer
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. If Flash memory is programmed to use the Watch-Dog Timer, or HALT/SLP
       instructions within the first few instructions after reset, the debugger
       may not be able to gain control of the target.
       Refer to FAQ 'How is the new Hardware Reset Implemented?' for
       information on how to apply a fix for this problem.

    2. The ZDS debugger may not be able to maintain a reliable connection
       with a target that uses the Watch-Dog Timer (WDT) to generate a
       reset so disabling the WDT during a debug session is recommended.
       If the WDT generates an NMI, the debugger will not lose the target
       connection and the default boot module's NMI handler may be replaced
       by an application specific NMI handler.

    3. The eZ80 and eZ80Acclaim! working registers may become corrupt during
       a debug session if code is executed from zero wait state memory.
       This applies to internal and external memory.
       Workaround:  Debug the code in one or more wait state memory.  You may
                    do this by adding wait states to the internal Flash or
                    the external Chip Select control register.

    4. Program execution may not break or will break after breakpoints that
       are set inside internal SRAM.

    5. The maximum amount of breakpoints supported by the hardware is three 
       while the simulator has no limit..

    6. The Zilog development tools may not reset all internal registers to
       their hardware reset state after a connection is established and/or a
       debug reset is performed.  This may allow a previously loaded program
       to interact with the operation of the current program's debug session.
       For example, if Flash was previously loaded with a program that uses
       timer 3 interrupts, a program that is running in debug mode and does
       NOT reset the timer 3 registers to disable its interrupts will still
       encounter a timer 3 interrupt request.
       Workaround:  Erase the internal flash with the integrated Flash Loader
                    to prevent any unused registers from being changed from
                    its hardware reset state.

    7. Some Port Authority USB to Serial DB9 adapters provided by Cables to Go
       are not compatible with the Serial Smart Cable for eZ80Acclaim!.

    8. ZDS may have difficulty establishing a connection if a Flash resident
       program has enabled and selected the PLL as the system clock.  In this
       event, select the Oscillator Clock option and set the System Clock
       Frequency equal to the frequency of the system clock that was used with
       the PLL enabled and selected.  Then erase the program, disconnect,
       restore the Clock settings to their appropriate values, and reconnect.
       Refer to the Debugging section of the FAQ for more information.

    9. The Flash programmer may identify blocks of Flash that are not
       physically present on the application board if the chip select that
       enables the Flash device is programmed with a higher boundary then
       what is physically available.

   10. The USB and Ethernet Smart Cable will hold the reset line low if
       it detects a target power loss.

   11. The ZDS flash programmer requires the external flash device memory
       locations to be aligned with the flash device's specified block
       arrangement, otherwise the entire flash device will not be erased or
       programmed correctly.
       For example, the Micron flash on the eZ80Acclaim! modules should be
       placed on a 1MB boundary because the upper four address lines are
       ignored when it is enabled.  If the chip select lower boundary is
       040000h, an access at the same location would result in an access
       of block 6 instead of block 0.

   12. Connecting the ZPAK's TIM directly to the target board's ZDI connector
       is recommended.  If an adaptor is required avoid using wire wrap or
       any other prototype material otherwise download, program and/or debug
       operations may not be reliable.  When using an adaptor, the following
       changes to the ZPAK TIM (Zilog PC: 99C0853-001) may help increase
       communication reliability:

       a) Change R10 to 10-22 Ohm.
       b) Change R6 to 2.2K if changing R10 does not help.

   13. Debug and Flash program operations may not be reliable on targets
       with system clock frequencies less than 5MHz.

   14. The simulator does not support UART input.

   15. The simulator treats halt/sleep instruction as a NOP.

   16. ZDS opens a UDP port to search for Ethernet Smart Cables and should be
       allowed to do so through an active firewall that stands between ZDS
       and the Ethernet Smart Cable.  The firewall may be disabled or
       configured to grant ZDS the right to open a local UDP port.  The local
       port number is assigned by the host and the foreign port number is 3000.

   17. Working with large projects across a network may saturate the 
       communication interface of the host computer.  ZDS may report "Not 
       Responding" messages while it is waiting for all the files to be opened.  
       ZDS is actually still loading information and will begin 'responding' 
       as soon as the transfer is complete.  It is recommended that the source 
       files be copied and installed on the ZDS host computer.

   18. Page Erase of internal Flash memory is used as the default to protect
       user data or programs (i.e. Boot Loaders) in Flash.  The user can 
       select mass erase by removing the check mark from the Project ->    
       Settings -> Debugger tab "Use Page Erase Before Flashing".  When Page 
       Erase is selected, note that the debugger will erase all pages within 
       the program's address range prior to programming Flash.   The address 
       range is determined by the lowest and highest addresses contained in 
       the .LOD file and those pages and all the pages in between are erased 
       in one step to speed the download process.  If the program overlaps a 
       page by a single byte the entire page will be erased. (i.e. For ROM 
       Address Range: 0-38, 8000-FF00, the .LOD download will erase the Flash 
       from 0-FFFF).  The Flash Loader can be used if you need to download
       non-overlapping .HEX files in non-sequential order because the ZDS 
       linker will sort the addresses when the file is created and the Flash 
       Loader can then determine the exact pages to erase.  (i.e. For ROM 
       address Range: 0-38, 8000-FF00 the .HEX download will erase 0-1FF 
       (entire page) and 8000-FFFF).

   19. Due to the instruction pipeline, it is not recommended to set a
       breakpoint on the 1st instruction of an ISR.
	   
       In version 5.2.0, a new option is provided that will take care of this
       issue for you automatically in your C code.  If you select "Insert NOPs
       to improve Debugger breakpoints” in the C > Advanced page of project
       settings, the compiler will insert a few NOPs at the beginning of your
       ISR, eliminating this problem.  You can then simply set the breakpoint
       in your C code on the opening curly brace of your ISR.  This option
       comes at the cost of a modest increase in code size from the added NOPs;
       when you’re finished debugging, turning the feature off again removes
       the NOPs and gets rid of the added code size.
	   
       If you choose not to use this new feature, you will need to manually
       ensure that you set breakpoints at least 3 bytes beyond the first 
       instruction of all ISRs.

   20. Why does it take a long time to hit a breakpoint in a loop or branch
       statement?

       Due to the instruction pipeline in eZ80, eZ80Acclaim! and 
       eZ80AcclaimPlus! processors, it is impossible to break execution on the
       instruction following a branch instruction such as JR, JP, LDIR, etc.
       This can lead to false breaks or extremely slow execution as the debugger
       repeatedly stops and resumes execution.
	   
       In version 5.2.0, a new option is provided that will take care of this 
       issue for you automatically in your C code.  If you select "Insert NOPs
       to improve Debugger breakpoints" in the C > Advanced page of project 
       settings, the compiler will insert a few NOPs following branch 
       instructions, eliminating this problem.  You can then simply set the
       breakpoint wherever you wish in your C code, and the debugger will 
       execute at its proper speed and break only when it should.  This option
       comes at the cost of a modest increase in code size from the added NOPs;
       when you’re finished debugging, turning the feature off again removes
       the NOPs and gets rid of the added code size.
	   
       If you choose not to use this new feature, you will need to manually
       ensure that you always set breakpoints 3 or 4 instructions beyond all
       branches for best execution speed and debugging results.

       Example (when "Insert NOPS to improve Debugger breakpoints is NOT selected):

       C- Code:
    
       static void breakpointDelayTest(void *addr_ptr,INT16 size) 
       {
         char *test_ptr;
         INT16 ctr = 0; 
         test_ptr = (char *)addr_ptr;
         while(ctr < size) 
         {
           *test_ptr = 0;
           test_ptr++;
           ctr++;
         }
       } ; setting a breakpoint here will set the breakpoint  at line 0003C1 below.

       Assembly Instructions:
       }
         0003BF 18D0 JR %391
       }
         0003C1 DDF9 LD SP,IX        ; instead of setting the BP on this line
         0003C3 DDE1 POP IX          ;
         0003C5 C9 RET               ; <<< it's recommended to insert breakpoint here
    
   21. Flashloader fails programming Spansion flash with USB firmware 1.8 at 5MHZ.
	    
       This is an issue related with the waitstate configured in the CSx_CTL rather than
       the firmware. At low frequency, on-chip debugger interface (ZDI) frequency sometimes
       does not in sync with the target frequency, resulting in a frequency mismatch. The 
       workaround in this case is to reduce the waitstates 4 or less.
		
    Compiler, Assembler, Linker/Locator, & Librarian
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. The ZDS II Assembler processes macros in a way that is more consistent 
       with the C preprocessor than was the case in ZDS I. Users converting 
       ZDS I projects to ZDS II projects and encountering problems with their 
       macros should contact Technical Support for help.

    2. Due to some efficiency improvements made in support routines for the 
       eZ80Acclaim! compiler in the 4.9.0 release of ZDS II, libraries and 
       objects built with the 4.9.0 or later compiler are not compatible with 
       libraries or objects built with earlier versions of the compiler.  If 
       your application includes pre-built libraries or object files, you will 
       need to rebuild them using the new compiler in order to use them with 
       newly built code.  Failure to do so may have several manifestations; 
       one that has been observed in several instances is that a breakpoint 
       set at the beginning of main() will never be reached.

    IDE
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Options available via Project > Settings... have been reworked for 
       more efficient and correct use.  Note that some options that existed
       in the multiple settings tabs have been moved to the General tab, most 
       notably Generate Debug Information.  Refer to the ZDS User Manual, 
       Online Help and FAQ for assistance.

    2. The Simulator is now a Debug Tool option, where previously it was a 
       target. This allows the Simulator to better operate more correctly 
       by using target configuration settings.

    3. The Motorola S-Record format is not supported.  Utilities exist to 
       convert files to the S-Record format from one or more of the formats 
       supported by ZDS II.  These may be acquired via the Internet using 
       an Internet search site such as Yahoo or Google.

    4. The project conversion utility can not be cancelled and will modify
       the original project (.zdsproj) file.  The backup (.zdsbak) file
       created by the conversion utility may be renamed and used with the
       original version of ZDS.  See the FAQ for more information.
	   
	5. During  the  loading  of  large  projects  (those with a large 
       number of files and/or file dependencies), the ZDS user 
       interface may become non-responsive (CR  7918)

    Sample Projects
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. When using the Serial Smart Cable and starter.zdsproj with eZ80F910x00KIT,
       selecting "[x] Use Alternate ZDI Frequency" option is recommended.
       Deselecting may result in unreliable download, program and debug
       operations.  This is generally observed as inconsistent memory reads.

    2. When using the USB Smart Cable and starter.zdsproj with eZ80F910x00KIT,
       deselecting "[ ] Use Alternate ZDI Frequency" option is recommended.
       Selecting this may result in unreliable download, program and debug
       operations.  This is generally observed as inconsistent memory reads.
       See the FAQ for more information.

    Zilog Standard Library (ZSL)
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Neither hardware nor software flow control is supported.

    Target Hardware
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. The IDE will issue a Hard Reset When connecting to the Target.  A Hard 
       Reset, as described in FAQ 'How is the new Hardware Reset 
       Implemented?', utilizes the target's reset line to reset the processor.  
       This allows the IDE to gain control of the processor in 4 clock cycles.  
       A reset issued while debugging is Soft Reset. A Soft Reset does not 
       gain control of the processor immediately and inserting sleep or halt 
       statements in  the beginning of the code should be avoided.

    2. The Ethernet circuit on F91 Mini Module board number is 99C0942-001
       Rev A and B only:  There is an error on the schematic for the F91 Mini
       Module, and as a result wrong value resistor is mounted on board.
       The R13 should be 6.49K ohm 1% (not 6.81K ohm 1% as shown).

    3. The PRSTn signal from JTAG connector on the eZ80 Development Platform
       (99C0858-001 rev B only) is not connected properly. This was fixed in 
       rev C of the board. For details, see the board schematics in the 
       eZ80 Development Kit User Manuals which can be found at 
       <documentation install>\Documentation\Tools_Documentation.

    4. The J11 silkscreen on the eZ80 Development Platform (99C0858-001) is 
       incorrect. It should be EN_FLASH.

    5. The -DIS_ETH pin on the eZ80190 Module (99C0877-001) is not functional.

    6. The RS-232 DB9 connector ground is not connected on eZ80F91 Modular
       Development Kit Platform (99C0945-001).  It will work if the host 
       system connector is grounded and a shielded ground cable is used.  
       Otherwise connect a wire between P2 pin 5 and P2's mounting holes 
       (shield).

    7. Correction to the eZ80F91 Module schematic in UM0142: The 4.7K 
       pull-down resistor R9 is not required nor recommended.  Remove the 
       resistor to correct; otherwise, JTAG may not function properly.

    8. The eZ80F91 Module 50MHz crystal oscillator circuit is different than
       the recommended circuit in the eZ80F91 product specification PS0192.
       The inductor side of the circuit, on the module, is connected to Xin
       (pin#86) instead of Xout (pin#85).  We recommend the oscillator
       circuit found in the eZ80Acclaim! product specification PS0192.

    9. The eZ80190 module distributed with the eZ801900200ZCO development kit
       uses a 50MHz system oscillator.  If the eZ80190 module is used with
       ZTP projects that use the CS8900 Ethernet controller, the 50MHz
       oscillator must be replaced with a 48MHz oscillator.  Otherwise the
       ZTP projects will not be able to exchange Ethernet data reliably and
       the system may fail to function.

       After replacing the oscillator, it will also be necessary to modify the
       "System Clock Frequency" in the "Configure Target" window from 50000000
       to 48000000.  The "Configure Target" window is accessed from the 
       "Setup" button on the Debugger tab of the Project Settings.  Be sure 
       the appropriate eZ80190 development platform is highlighted.  For 
       example, if you are using the eZ80190 module and the ZPAK II emulator, 
       select the "eZ80DevPlatform_190_Flash - Ethernet" or 
       "eZ80DevPlatform_190_RAM - Ethernet" target configuration depending on 
       your project configuration.

       If you would prefer Zilog to replace the 50MHz oscillator, please 
       contact Zilog customer support for a Return Merchandise Authorization 
       (RMA).

    10. For eZ80 Development Platforms that contain 74LVC244A (U1, U3 and U5):

        Factory rework: Replace 74LVC244A with 74LV244A  The F91 has a very tight 
        timing for read and write operation. Because of the differences of the
        speed of the address  and read/write  drivers  on  the main board, the 
        data in the SRAM  on  the  main board is being corrupted.  To fix  the 
        above mentioned problem we recommend to put a slower drivers (74LV244A)
        on the address bus, which fixes the problem with SRAM corruption.

    Un-installation
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. The Un-installation may not work if WScript.exe in Windows System directory is
       corrupt or missing. In this case, user needs to manually execute the uninstallztp.bat
       first and then uninstall.bat from the ZDSII installation directory.

    (Fixed in 5.2.0)
       CR 13242 Some bit-field manipulating code gives a P3 internal error
