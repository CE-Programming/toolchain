### GraphX Template

You can clone this directory for your own GraphX-based projects.

To add code, fill in the begin, end, step, and draw functions in main.c. You can also create your own .c and .h files and add them to the directory; the Makefile included in this template will automatically find and compile the new .c files.

In addition, you can also add your own .asm files, which will be detected and
added appropriately to the proper segment.
