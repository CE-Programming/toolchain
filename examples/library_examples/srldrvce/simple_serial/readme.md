### CE C SDK Template

This is a template for programs that use the [TI-84 Plus CE C/C++ Toolchain](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain).
You can clone this directory for your own projects.
Note that for graphical programs, it is recommended to start from the [graphx template](https://github.com/CE-Programming/graphx-template) instead of this one.

To add code, fill in the `int main(void)` function in main.c. You can also create
your own source and header files and add them to the directory; the makefile
will automatically find and compile the new source files.

For more information, see the [toolchain's documentation](https://ce-programming.github.io/toolchain/index.html).
