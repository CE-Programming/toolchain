Welcome to the CE C/C++ Toolchain!
==================================

The CE C/C++ Toolchain allows you to create incredible programs using the standard C/C++ language.
Additionally, the CE Libraries are used to aid in rapid development by implementing
optimized routines for graphics, file I/O, fonts, keypad input, and more.

If this is your first introduction to the CE Toolchain, check out the :ref:`getting_started` page.
You can join us on the :code:`CE Programming` Discord server in the :code:`#ez80-dev` channel by clicking the below invite button if you have any questions.

The toolchain works natively across all major OSes, and has been developed by a few
people who find the challenge entertaining. If you are interested in contributing your expertise,
