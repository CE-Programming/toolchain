The CE C Toolchain incorporates a variety of tools in order to build programs in C/C++ natively for the TI-84 Plus CE calculator series.

## Getting Started

Visit the [CE C Toolchain documentation](https://ce-programming.github.io/toolchain).
This site hosts all the information for working with the toolchain.

## Getting Help

You can join us on the `CE Programming` Discord server in the `#ez80-dev` channel: [Discord Chat Link](https://discord.gg/PMXR8P2T).\
If you prefer IRC, the chat is also bridged to the Efnet channel `#ez80-dev`.

Depending on how active the channel is you might not get a response.\
In that case, post your questions [here](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain/discussions) or [here](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain/issues), and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
