The CE C Software Development Kit incorporates a wide variety of tools and documentation in order to build programs in C natively for the TI-84 Plus CE / TI-83 Premium CE calculators series.

## Getting Started

It is recommended that you grab the latest release from [here](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain/releases/latest) if you are looking to get started. Feel free to also bookmark the [wiki pages](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain/wiki), as they will become quite helpful.

Included you will find examples using the ['Standard' CE C Libraries](https://github.com/CE-Programming/libraries/releases/latest). These provide efficient and easy support for graphics, file I/O, keypad input, etc. Be sure to grab them if you plan to use them.  
The [header documentation](https://ce-programming.github.io/toolchain/files.html) will let you know about the available functions.

## Help

You can join us on the EFNet IRC server, on the `#ez80-dev` channel, if you have any questions ([webchat link](http://chat.efnet.org:9090/?nick=sdk-user&channels=%23ez80-dev&Login=Login)).  
If you don't get a response in a reasonable amount of time, feel free to ask it [here](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain/issues) and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
