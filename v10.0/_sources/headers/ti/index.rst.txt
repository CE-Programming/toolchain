TI Operating System Headers
===========================

These headers are specific to functionality provided by the calculator's operating system, and contain various defines and prototypes.

TI used to provide a free SDK for the TI-83 Plus, which is now no longer available.
However, the TI-84 Plus CE software is directly derived from the TI-83 Plus software,
so we do have a lot of official, though dated, information.
This is also why names are inconsistent: sometimes TI's names don't follow a pattern, and other times,
whoever in the community first discovered something gave it a name following their own logic.
