Welcome to the CE C/C++ Toolchain!
==================================

The CE C/C++ Toolchain allows you to create incredible programs for the TI-84 Plus CE/TI-83 Premium CE (with or without Python) using the standard C/C++ language.

If this is your first introduction to the CE Toolchain, check out the :ref:`getting_started` page.
You can join us on the :code:`CE Programming` Discord server in the :code:`#ez80-dev` channel by clicking the below invite button if you have any questions.
