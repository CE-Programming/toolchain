-- Template ----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can clone this directory for your own projects. You can either specify
arguments like the TARGET by editing the Makefile, or on the command line, like this:
    make TARGET=myprog

To add code, fill in the void main() function in main.c. You can also create your
own .c and .h files and add them to the directory; the Makefile included in this
template will automatically find and compile the new .c files.

In addition, you can also add your own .asm files, which will be detected and added
appropritately to the proper segment.
