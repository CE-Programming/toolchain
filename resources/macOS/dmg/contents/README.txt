CE C toolchain - macOS release install notes
--------------------------------------------

If you're updating from a previous toolchain, back up any of your own files already present in your CEdev directory (which may be in ~/CEdev or /opt/CEdev), somewhere else temporarily.

Then follow the getting started guide: https://ce-programming.github.io/toolchain/static/getting-started.html (When it says "Extract the archive", it's about the dmg for us mac users, so you'll just want to drag'n'drop the CEdev folder in your home directory, for instance, which is /Users/YOURNAME/ (or "~" as a shortcut). You can open a new finder window and go there by pressing Cmd-Shift-H.
