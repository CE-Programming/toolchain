Welcome to the CE C Toolchain!
==============================

The CE C Toolchain allows you to create incredible programs using the standard C language.
Additionally, the CE C Libraries are used to aid in rapid development by implementing
optimized routines for graphics, file I/O, fonts, keypad input, and more.

The toolchain works natively across all major OSes, and has been developed by a few
people who find the challenge entertaining. If you are interested in contributing your expertise,
visit the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain>`_.

If this is your first introduction to the CE C Toolchain, start with :ref:`getting_started`.
